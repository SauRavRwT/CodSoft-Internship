                            <p>“It is not wise to judge others based on your own preconceptions and by their appearances.”</p>
                            <p class="p-2 mx-5">Itachi is a member of the Uchiha Clan from the village of Konohagakure
                                and the elder brother of Sasuke Uchiha. He grew up as the child prodigy of the Uchiha
                                clan, establishing milestones for not only Sasuke, but also for future Uchiha to live up
                                to.[17] His early childhood was marred by war, the violence of which caused him to seek
                                peace at any cost. Upon learning that his clan was planning a coup d'état to take
                                control of Konoha, after his clan was accused of attacking the village with the
                                Nine-Tails, Itachi provides Konoha with intelligence on his clan's actions during his
                                two years as a member of the ANBU. Over time, Itachi distances himself from his clan, as
                                some clan members believed he murdered his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, to gain the
                                Mangekyo Sharingan.
                            </p>
                            <p>Itachi Uchiha was an INFJ personality type. He intuitively understood others and could
                                naturally detect their motivations. Being so in touch with people’s emotions, INFJs can
                                even know how someone else is feeling before that person knows it themselves.

                                Itachi Uchiha was sensitive and reserved but he wasn’t afraid to stand up for his values
                                when it was something that he cared ghostoftheuchihaly about.

                                Itachi Uchiha Personality Type, Zodiac Sign & Enneagram
                                Itachi Uchiha had a talent for language and was generally expressive, at least on a
                                surface level. As an INFJ, he had a vivid inner life, but people of this personality
                                type are known for being exceptionally private.

                                While Itachi Uchiha was quiet and sensitive, he was also a good leader. With strong
                                ideals, he was known for his kindness and empathy.</p>

                            <p>"The world doesn't need to evolve any further. It can fall under the genjutsu of the
                                Infinite Tsukuyomi."</p>
                            <p class="p-2 mx-5">Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was the legendary leader of the
                                Uchiha Clan. He founded Konohagakure alongside his childhood friend and rival, Hashirama
                                Senju, with the intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree
                                on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which
                                ended in Madara's death. Madara, however, rewrote his death and went into hiding to work
                                on his own plans. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge
                                and plans to Obito shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be
                                revived, only to see his plans foiled and ultimately, and finally, realising the error
                                of his ways and making amends with Hashirama before his final death.</p>
                            <p>
                                Madara Uchiha's most defining trait is his monumental ego. He is an extremely
                                egocentric, manipulative and conceited man who cares only about might and skills, which
                                shows as he belittles everyone he deems weaker; including the immensely powerful Kage
                                and the formidable Kurama. The only one he respects is Hashirama Senju, whom he admired
                                immensely but grew to hate fiercely. His ego however, seems at best justifiable, given
                                that he was able to defeat the Five Kage with ease, and even took down an entire
                                battalion with little to no effort.

                                Madara is a staunch and dependable battle-lover who lives and breathes to fight, which
                                he calls "dancing". However, he only involves himself in battles he deems challenging,
                                going as far as to keep his foes alive as long as he is having fun. On the other hand,
                                he will slaughter mercilessly those who do not interest him or worse. Although he never
                                bothers fighting at full strength, he shows off his powerful techniques for no other
                                reason than that he can.

                                pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in search of knowledge
                                that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote, and, posthumously, the world
                                in its entirety – knowledge that would be passed on to his godson and final student,
                                Naruto Uzumaki.</p>
                            <p>
                                After he graduated from Konoha's Ninja Academy, Jiraiya was teamed with Orochimaru and
                                Tsunade under the leadership of Hiruzen Sarutobi. Hiruzen gave them a bell test for the
                                team's first exercise, during which Jiraiya repeatedly fell for Hiruzen's tricks, and
                                for failing to acquire a bell, he was tied to a stump as punishment. Hiruzen encouraged
                                Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru, but Jiraiya countered that his Transparent Escape
                                Technique was a fair testament to his skills, as he could spy on bathing women without
                                getting caught: Hiruzen offered to accompany him to see if this was true. Jiraiya had
                                a certain interest in Tsunade from their first meeting, and when her breasts
                                developed, she became a frequent target of his peepings. She nearly killed him when she
                                caught him on one occasion, forcing him to be more discreet about his interests.
